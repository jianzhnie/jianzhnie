### Hi there 👋
Hey, I am jianzhnie, Thanks for stopping by!

I work as a full-time Machine Learning engineer and write tutorials on basic and advanced topics (NLP, Computer vision and code - lots of it).

I read and think a lot. And sometimes I put them in a form of a painting or a piece of music. And when I need to catch a breath I go for a run.

### I’m currently working on 🔭 

- Developing nlp-toolkit [nlp-toolkit ](https://github.com/jianzhnie/nlp-toolkit)
- Developing MultiModalTransformers [MultiModalTransformers ](https://github.com/jianzhnie/MultimodalTransformers)
- Developing AutoML tools for DeepLearning Project and MacheLearning Project [AutoTimm](https://github.com/jianzhnie/AutoTimm)  | [AutoTabular](https://github.com/jianzhnie/AutoTabular)
- Trying hard to reduce the Learning Machine Learning(LML) loss 😂
- Coding everyday for better research engineering skill

### I’m currently learning 🌱

- Theoretical Machine Learning from the basic
- Pytorch and Pytorch-lightning
- Self-Supervised Learning [self_supervised](https://github.com/jianzhnie/self_supervised)
- Transformer models (BERT,GPT, T5, VIT, SwinTransformer)
- Reinformnet Learning (DQN, A2C, PPO, SAC, TD3 ...)
