## Hi there 👋

Hey, I am jianzhnie, Thanks for stopping by!

I work as a full-time Machine Learning engineer and write tutorials on basic and advanced topics (NLP, Reinforcement Learning , Computer vision and code - lots of it).

I read and think a lot. And sometimes I put them in a form of a painting or a piece of music. And when I need to catch a breath I go for a run.

## I’m currently working on 🔭

### Reinforcement Learning

| Code Repo                                                    | About                                                        |
