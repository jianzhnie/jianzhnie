### Hi there 👋
Hey, I am jianzhnie, Thanks for stopping by!

I am from a great country called China.

I work as a full-time Machine Learning engineer and write tutorials on basic and advanced topics (NLP, Computer vision and code - lots of it).

I read and think a lot. And sometimes I put them in a form of a painting or a piece of music. And when I need to catch a breath I go for a run.

You can:
- 📖  Read some of [my blogs](https://www.zhihu.com/column/fengnie) 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Transformer models for both Text, Images and Tabular data.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on NLP and MultiModal machine learning
- 📫 How to reach me: https://github.com/jianzhnie

Have an awesome day!
